# Ark client sample — registering and using an OAuth 2.1 / OIDC client

A client-only ASP.NET Core web application. It has no database, no identity provider and no
protocol code of its own: sign-in, PKCE, `state`, `nonce`, JWKS rollover and silent token refresh
all come from ASP.NET Core's OpenID Connect handler, configured by `AddArkOidcClient`.

Use it two ways:

* **as a walkthrough** — run it and open `/`, which prints the exact values to register and checks
  them live against the provider's discovery document;
* **as a template** — copy `Program.cs`, the `ark_oauth_client` section of `appsettings.json` and
  `Controllers/AccountController.cs` into a new project. That is the whole integration.

## The short version

| | |
|---|---|
| Identity provider | `https://localhost:7233` (`Ark.oAuth.Oidc.Host`) |
| Tenant | `ark_idp` |
| Issuer / Authority | `https://localhost:7233/ark_idp` |
| This app | `https://localhost:7255` |
| client_id | `ark_sample_web` |
| Redirect URI | `https://localhost:7255/signin-oidc` |
| Post-logout redirect URI | `https://localhost:7255/signout-callback-oidc` |
| Scopes | `openid profile email offline_access` |
| Client type | public (no secret) + PKCE |
| Test credentials | `admin` / `admin` (seeded on the provider's first run) |

```bash
dotnet run --project Ark.oAuth.Oidc.Host   # terminal 1 — the provider
dotnet run --project Ark.Client.Web        # terminal 2 — this app
```

---

## Step 1 — Run the identity provider

```bash
dotnet run --project Ark.oAuth.Oidc.Host
```

On first run it creates its SQLite database, generates an RSA signing key, seeds the scope
catalogue and creates an `admin` / `admin` account.

Confirm the discovery document is served:

```bash
curl -s https://localhost:7233/ark_idp/.well-known/openid-configuration | jq .issuer
# "https://localhost:7233/ark_idp"
```

**This URL is the only thing this application needs to know about the provider.** The authorize,
token, userinfo, jwks and end-session endpoints are all read from it, so there is no public key
to paste and nothing to change when a signing key rotates.

---

## Step 2 — Register the client

Sign in to the admin console at `https://localhost:7233/ark_idp/admin` (as `admin`), open
**Clients**, and add a client:

| Field | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `client_id` | `ark_sample_web` | Must match `ark_oauth_client:ClientId`. |
| `client_name` | `Ark Client Sample` | Shown on the sign-in and consent screens. |
| `application_type` | `web` | Server-side rendered application. |
| `token_endpoint_auth_method` | `none` | No secret — this is a public client. See [Confidential clients](#confidential-clients). |
| `redirect_uris` | `https://localhost:7255/signin-oidc` | Matched **exactly**. No wildcards, no prefix matching, no trailing-slash tolerance. |
| `post_logout_redirect_uris` | `https://localhost:7255/signout-callback-oidc` | Required for RP-initiated logout to return the user. |
| `grant_types` | `authorization_code`, `refresh_token` | `refresh_token` is what lets a session outlive the first access token. |
| `scopes` | `openid profile email offline_access` | A scope the client is not registered for is **rejected**, not silently dropped. |
| `require_pkce` | `true` | Mandatory for public clients; `S256` only. |
| `is_active` | `true` | |

The redirect URIs come from `CallbackPath` and `SignedOutCallbackPath` plus the app's own origin.
Change the port in `launchSettings.json` and both registrations have to change with it — the
home page prints the current values so there is nothing to work out by hand.

> Registration is also available over the wire as RFC 7591 dynamic client registration
> (`POST /{tenant}/oauth2/register`), but it is off by default. The admin console is the normal
> path.

---

## Step 3 — Grant a user access

**Not optional, and the easiest step to miss.** Ark authorizes per user *per client*: a user with
no mapping to this client cannot sign in to it at all, and the sign-in page reports only that the
credentials were not recognised — deliberately, so the form cannot be used to enumerate accounts.

In the admin console open **Access mapping** and add: user `admin`, client `ark_sample_web`, with
claims:

```
sub  name  email  email_verified  sample.admin
```

Two kinds of claim live in that one list:

* **Identity claims** (`name`, `email`, `email_verified`, …) — filtered by the granted scopes and
  returned in the ID token and from UserInfo.
* **Authorization claims** (anything else, e.g. `sample.admin`) — delivered in the access token as
  `ark_claims` and projected by the client onto `ark_oauth_client:RoleClaimType` (default `role`),
  so `[Authorize(Roles = "sample.admin")]` works against them.

Claims are written into tokens when they are issued, so a change takes effect at the user's next
sign-in, not immediately.

---

## Step 4 — Configure the application

`Program.cs` — two lines, plus middleware in the right order:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddArkOidcClient(builder.Configuration);
...
app.UseRouting();        // must come before the two below
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
```

`appsettings.json`:

```jsonc
"ark_oauth_client": {
  "Authority": "https://localhost:7233/ark_idp",
  "ClientId": "ark_sample_web",
  "ClientSecret": null,
  "Scopes": [ "openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access" ],
  "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
  "SignedOutCallbackPath": "/signout-callback-oidc",
  "SignedOutRedirectUri": "/",
  "AuthErrorPath": "/",
  "RequireHttpsMetadata": true,
  "CookieName": "ark_sample_web_auth",
  "RoleClaimType": "role"
}
```

`Authority` and `ClientId` are the only required keys. Everything else has a working default.

`CallbackPath` and `SignedOutCallbackPath` are served by the handler itself — **do not add
controller actions for them.** An action at `/signin-oidc` shadows the handler and the callback
never completes.

---

## Step 5 — Run and verify

```bash
dotnet run --project Ark.Client.Web
```

Open <https://localhost:7255>. The home page re-derives every value above from configuration and
checks it against the live discovery document — reachability, issuer match, unsupported scopes —
so a registration mistake shows up as a sentence rather than an `invalid_request` page.

Then walk the pages:

| Page | Shows |
|---|---|
| `/home/secure` | `[Authorize]` and nothing else — reaching it means the whole flow completed. |
| `/home/profile` | Claims on the principal, plus the decoded access and ID tokens. |
| `/home/roles` | `ark_claims` → role projection, granted or not. |
| `/home/downstream` | Calling an API with the user's access token. |
| Sign out | RP-initiated logout through the provider's `end_session_endpoint`. |

What happens on the wire, for reference:

```
GET  /account/login
  302 → {authority}/oauth2/authorize?client_id=…&redirect_uri=…&response_type=code
        &scope=openid%20profile%20email%20offline_access&code_challenge=…&code_challenge_method=S256
        &state=…&nonce=…
POST {authority}/oauth2/authorize            (credentials, then consent)
  302 → https://localhost:7255/signin-oidc?code=…&state=…
  ↳ the handler exchanges the code with code_verifier, validates the ID token against JWKS,
    and writes the encrypted authentication cookie
  302 → /home/profile
```

---

## Using it from application code

**Require sign-in**

```csharp
[Authorize]
public IActionResult Secure() => View();
```

**Require an authorization claim**

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "sample.admin")]
public IActionResult Billing() => View();
```

**Read the user**

```csharp
var subject = User.FindFirst("sub")?.Value;
var email   = User.FindFirst("email")?.Value;
var roles   = User.FindAll("role").Select(c => c.Value);
```

**Call a downstream API**

```csharp
var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, "https://api.example.com/things");
await request.WithArkTokenAsync(HttpContext);
using var response = await httpClient.SendAsync(request);
```

Read the token at call time — never cache it. The cookie handler refreshes it roughly two minutes
before expiry, and a captured copy goes stale.

**Sign in / sign out explicitly**

```csharp
// challenge
Challenge(new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/" }, ArkOidcClient.OidcScheme);

// sign out locally *and* at the provider
SignOut(new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/" },
        ArkOidcClient.CookieScheme, ArkOidcClient.OidcScheme);
```

**Protect an API instead of a UI**

```csharp
builder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddArkOidcApi(arkConfig);
```

---

## Confidential clients

A server-side web application can hold a secret, and should where the deployment allows it.

1. Set `token_endpoint_auth_method` to `client_secret_post` (or `client_secret_basic`) on the
   client record.
2. Press **Regenerate secret** in the admin console. The value is shown **once** — only a PBKDF2
   hash is stored, so it cannot be read back.
3. Put it somewhere other than `appsettings.json`:

```bash
dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "ark_oauth_client:ClientSecret" "<the secret>"
```

Nothing in the code changes. PKCE stays on: it protects the authorization code regardless of
client authentication.

---

## Porting this into a new project

```bash
dotnet new mvc -n MyApp
cd MyApp
dotnet add package Ark.oAuth.Client
```

Then:

1. Copy the `ark_oauth_client` section into `appsettings.json`; change `ClientId` and, if the
   provider differs, `Authority`.
2. Add `builder.Services.AddArkOidcClient(builder.Configuration);` and make sure `UseRouting()`
   precedes `UseAuthentication()` / `UseAuthorization()`.
3. Copy `Controllers/AccountController.cs` for the sign-in and sign-out endpoints.
4. Register the new `client_id` and its two redirect URIs on the provider (Step 2), and add the
   access mapping (Step 3).
5. If the installed `Ark.oAuth.Client` package predates the dependency pins, keep the
   `Microsoft.IdentityModel.*` `PackageReference` lines from `Ark.Client.Web.csproj` — see below.

Because this is the standard ASP.NET Core handler underneath, pointing the same application at
Entra ID, Okta, Auth0 or Keycloak is a change of `Authority` and `ClientId` alone.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `Cannot redirect to the authorization endpoint, the configuration may be missing or invalid.` | Either the provider is unreachable, **or** a split `Microsoft.IdentityModel` graph — `Protocols[.OpenIdConnect]` at 7.x against `Tokens` at 8.x. Check with `dotnet list package --include-transitive`; every `Microsoft.IdentityModel.*` must be the same major version. Nothing warns at build time. |
| Sign-in page says the credentials were not recognised, and they are correct | No access mapping for that user *and* this client — Step 3. |
| `invalid_request` / `unauthorized_client` at `/oauth2/authorize` | The `client_id` is not registered in that tenant, is inactive, or is missing the `authorization_code` grant. |
| `invalid_request` naming `redirect_uri` | The registered URI does not match byte for byte — scheme, host, port, path, trailing slash. |
| `invalid_scope` | The client is not registered for a scope it asked for. Registered scopes are a whitelist, not a filter. |
| Callback returns to `/?auth_error=…` | The handler's remote failure hook. The message names the failing check — usually a correlation cookie lost to a scheme or host change mid-flow. |
| No `refresh_token` | `offline_access` was not requested or not granted. |
| Signed out locally but signing in again asks nothing | Only the cookie scheme was signed out. Sign out of both schemes to end the provider session too. |
| Callback loops or 404s | A controller action is shadowing `/signin-oidc`. |
| `RequireHttpsMetadata` errors on a plain-http provider | Development only: set it to `false`. Never in production. |

---

## Before production

1. Change the seeded `admin` / `admin` password on the provider.
2. Keep `RequireHttpsMetadata` at `true`.
3. Give confidential clients real secrets, kept outside source control, and set
   `token_endpoint_auth_method` to match.
4. Register production redirect URIs explicitly; they are matched exactly, so a staging URI is not
   a substring away from working.
5. Leave dynamic client registration off unless it is deliberately needed.
