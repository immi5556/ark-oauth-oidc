    /// Everything here is doable in the admin console already; the point is that it is doable in
    /// one call, from another system, without a person clicking through five panels in the right
    /// order. The two operations are:
    ///
    ///   * <c>POST v1/provision/client</c>   — register an application and give a user access to it.
    ///   * <c>POST v1/activation/{client|user}</c> — switch either of them off, and back on.
    ///
    /// Authorization is the same as the rest of the management API: a bare <c>[Authorize]</c>
    /// against the host's default scheme, which makes the caller a global operator over every
    /// tenant. See the operator-vs-tenant note on <see cref="ManageController"/>. A host that
    /// wants machine callers rather than a browser session registers a bearer scheme as its
    /// default (or an additional one) — nothing here assumes a cookie.
    ///
    /// Responses keep the <c>{ error, msg, data }</c> shape the rest of the management API uses,
    /// and add a stable <c>code</c> so a caller can branch without matching on prose. Unlike the
    /// rest of the API, failures also carry a real HTTP status — a provisioning script is not a
    /// person reading a toast, and "already exists" has to be distinguishable from "worked"
    /// without parsing the body.
