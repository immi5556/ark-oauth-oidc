# ARK Identity Server

A self-contained OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect provider for ASP.NET Core, distributed as two
NuGet packages: `Ark.oAuth.Oidc` (the server) and `Ark.oAuth.Client` (the client).

It is multi-tenant, runs on SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server, and ships its own sign-in,
consent and admin UI. Point any standard OpenID Connect library at the issuer URL and it will
configure itself.

| Specification | Status |
|---|---|
| OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework (RFC 6749) | Authorization code, refresh token, client credentials |
| PKCE (RFC 7636) | **Required** for public clients, `S256` only |
| OpenID Connect Core 1.0 | ID tokens, UserInfo, `nonce`, `at_hash`/`c_hash`, `auth_time`, `sid` |
| OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0 | `/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata (RFC 8414) | `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` |
| JSON Web Key Set (RFC 7517) | `/.well-known/jwks.json`, with two-phase key rotation |
| JWT Profile for Access Tokens (RFC 9068) | `typ: at+jwt`, `client_id`, `jti`, `scope` |
| Token Introspection (RFC 7662) | Access and refresh tokens |
| Token Revocation (RFC 7009) | Revokes the whole refresh-token family |
| Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628) | With `verification_uri_complete` |
| Pushed Authorization Requests (RFC 9126) | Optional, can be made mandatory |
| Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591/7592) | Optional, off by default |

| Authorization Server Issuer Identification (RFC 9207) | `iss` in the authorization response |
| Native Apps (RFC 8252) | Loopback redirect URIs with variable ports |

Deliberately **not** supported: the implicit grant, the hybrid flow, and the resource owner
password credentials grant. All three are removed in OAuth 2.1.

---

## Quick start

### 1. Create a host project

```bash
dotnet new mvc -n MyIdp
cd MyIdp
dotnet add package Ark.oAuth.Oidc
dotnet add package Ark.oAuth.Client
```

### 2. `Program.cs`

```csharp
using Ark.oAuth;
using Ark.oAuth.Oidc;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddArkOidcServer(builder.Environment);   // the identity provider
builder.Services.AddArkOidcClient(builder.Configuration); // the admin console is itself a client
builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

var app = builder.Build();

if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();        // must come before UseAuthentication / UseAuthorization
app.UseArkAuthData();    // one-time database bootstrap
app.UseArkOidcClient();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllerRoute(name: "default", pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
app.Run();
```

> **Middleware order matters.** `UseRouting()` has to run before `UseAuthentication()` and
> `UseAuthorization()`. Without a selected endpoint, the authorization middleware cannot see the
> `[Authorize]` metadata it is supposed to enforce.

### 3. `appsettings.json`

```jsonc
{
  "ark_oauth_server": {
    "TenantId": "my_idp",              // a client named "<TenantId>_client" is created for the admin console
    "BasePath": "",                    // set if the app is hosted under a sub-path
    "BaseUrl": "https://idp.example.com",
    "Provider": "sqlite",              // sqlite (default) | mysql | postgres | sqlserver
    "EnableLogTrace": true,
    "UploadPath": "./wwwroot/{0}/",
    "DefaultPw": "<initial password for new users>",
    "EmailConfig": {
      "email": "idp@example.com",
      "pw": "<smtp password>",
      "from": "idp@example.com",
      "display": "Example (IdP)",
      "subject": "Example IdP: ",
      "smtp": "smtp.example.com",
      "port": 25,
      "host_logo": "https://idp.example.com/img/logo.png",
      "activation_link": "https://idp.example.com/oauth/{0}/v1/password/reset/{1}",
      "host_company_display": "Example Identity Provider",
      "privacy_policy_url": "https://example.com/privacy",
      "terms_url": "https://example.com/terms"
    }
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "ArkAuthConnection": "Data Source=./data/ark_auth.db"
  }
}
```

### 4. Run

```bash
mkdir -p data && dotnet run
```

On first run the server creates its schema, generates an RSA signing key **locally**, seeds the
OIDC scope catalogue, and creates an `admin` / `admin` account. **Change that password before
exposing the server.**

Your issuer is now:

```
https://idp.example.com/my_idp
```

and the discovery document is at:

```
https://idp.example.com/my_idp/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

---

## Integrating an application

There is one URL to know — the **issuer**. Everything else is discovered.

A complete, runnable client is in **`Ark.oAuth.Oidc/Ark.Client.Web`** — a client-only ASP.NET Core
app whose [README](Ark.oAuth.Oidc/Ark.Client.Web/README.md) walks the whole process: registering
the client, granting a user access to it, configuring the app, and using the result (protected
pages, role claims, calling a downstream API, sign-out). Its home page checks its own registration
against the live discovery document, so setup mistakes surface as a sentence rather than an
`invalid_request` page. Start from it for new client applications.

Signed in to the admin console, each client has a generated setup page at:

```
/{tenant_id}/oauth2/integrate/{client_id}
```

It renders the exact values and copy-paste config for that client: issuer, client ID, scopes,
redirect URIs, and working snippets for the Ark client package, the raw ASP.NET Core handler,
`oidc-client-ts`, Authlib and `go-oidc`. Because it is generated from the client's own
registration, it cannot drift out of date.

---

## The client package

`Ark.oAuth.Client` configures ASP.NET Core's own OpenID Connect and cookie handlers. It is not a
hand-rolled protocol implementation, so PKCE, `state`, `nonce`, JWKS rollover and token refresh
are handled by the framework.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddArkOidcClient(builder.Configuration);
```

```jsonc
{
  "ark_oauth_client": {
    "Authority": "https://idp.example.com/my_idp",
    "ClientId": "my-app",
    "ClientSecret": null,                 // omit for public clients (SPA, native, browser apps)
    "Scopes": ["openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access"],
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
    "SignedOutCallbackPath": "/signout-callback-oidc",
    "RequireHttpsMetadata": true
  }
}
```

Then use `[Authorize]` as normal. Reading tokens:

```csharp
var accessToken = await HttpContext.GetArkAccessTokenAsync();

// or attach it to a downstream call
var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, "https://api.example.com/things");
await request.WithArkTokenAsync(HttpContext);
```

Ark authorization claims (`ark_claims` in the access token) are projected onto the principal as
role claims, so they work with policies directly:

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "billing.admin")]
public IActionResult Billing() => View();
```

### Protecting an API

```csharp
builder.Services
    .AddAuthentication()
    .AddArkOidcApi(arkConfig);
```

### The flows the handler does not cover

`AddArkOidcClient` also registers three services for the cases outside interactive sign-in. All
three read the provider's discovery document, so they need the issuer and nothing else.

| Service | For |
|---|---|
| `ArkSetupProbe` | Pairs local configuration with the provider's metadata and returns `ArkSetupModel` — issuer mismatch, unregistered scopes, the exact redirect URI this app will send. Render it and a registration mistake reads as a sentence instead of `invalid_client`. |
| `ArkClientCredentials` | The client credentials grant, with `GetTokenAsync` caching until shortly before expiry and `RequestTokenAsync` for a live exchange. |
| `ArkRegistration` | Dynamic client registration (RFC 7591) and management (RFC 7592). |

```csharp
var model  = await setup.ProbeAsync(HttpContext);
var token  = await credentials.GetTokenAsync(clientId, secret, new[] { "reports.read" });
var client = await registration.RegisterAsync(metadata, token.AccessToken);
```

### Talking to a different provider

Because this is the standard handler, changing `Authority` and `ClientId` is enough to point the
same application at Entra ID, Okta, Auth0 or Keycloak.

---

## Endpoints

All paths are relative to the issuer, `{BaseUrl}/{TenantId}`.

| Purpose | Path |
|---|---|
| Discovery | `/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| Discovery (RFC 8414 name) | `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` |
| JWKS | `/.well-known/jwks.json` |
| Authorization | `/oauth2/authorize` |
| Token | `/oauth2/token` |
| UserInfo | `/oauth2/userinfo` |
| Introspection | `/oauth2/introspect` |
| Revocation | `/oauth2/revoke` |
| End session | `/oauth2/logout` |
| Device authorization | `/oauth2/device_authorization` |
| Device verification (user-facing) | `/oauth2/device` |
| Pushed authorization request | `/oauth2/par` |
| Dynamic registration | `/oauth2/register` |
| Client setup page | `/oauth2/integrate/{client_id}` |

---

## Flows

### Authorization code + PKCE

The default for web, SPA and native applications.

```
GET /{tenant}/oauth2/authorize
      ?response_type=code
      &client_id=my-app
      &redirect_uri=https://app.example.com/signin-oidc
      &scope=openid%20profile%20email%20offline_access
      &state=<random>
      &nonce=<random>
      &code_challenge=<BASE64URL(SHA256(verifier))>
      &code_challenge_method=S256
```

```
POST /{tenant}/oauth2/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code
&code=<code>
&redirect_uri=https://app.example.com/signin-oidc
&client_id=my-app
&code_verifier=<verifier>
```

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ…",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "…",
  "id_token": "eyJ…",
  "scope": "openid profile email offline_access"
}
```

A `refresh_token` is issued only when `offline_access` is granted.

### Refresh token

Rotation is on by default: each refresh returns a new refresh token and retires the old one.
Presenting an already-used token is treated as theft and **revokes the entire token family**.

```
grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=<token>&client_id=my-app
```

Scope may be narrowed on refresh, never widened.

### Client credentials

For service-to-service calls. Requires client authentication — a public client cannot use it.

```bash
curl -X POST https://idp.example.com/my_idp/oauth2/token \
  -u 'my-service:<secret>' \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
  -d 'scope=reports.read'
```

### Device authorization grant

For TVs, CLIs and other input-constrained devices.

```bash
curl -X POST https://idp.example.com/my_idp/oauth2/device_authorization \
  -u 'my-device:<secret>' -d 'scope=openid profile'
```

```json
{
  "device_code": "…",
  "user_code": "WDJB-MJHT",
  "verification_uri": "https://idp.example.com/my_idp/oauth2/device",
  "verification_uri_complete": "https://idp.example.com/my_idp/oauth2/device?user_code=WDJB-MJHT",
  "expires_in": 600,
  "interval": 5
}
```

The device then polls the token endpoint with
`grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code`, receiving `authorization_pending`
until the user approves, and `slow_down` if it polls faster than `interval`.

### Pushed authorization requests

Submit the authorization parameters over the back channel first:

```bash
curl -X POST https://idp.example.com/my_idp/oauth2/par \
  -u 'my-app:<secret>' \
  -d 'response_type=code' -d 'redirect_uri=https://app.example.com/cb' \
  -d 'scope=openid' -d 'code_challenge=<challenge>' -d 'code_challenge_method=S256'
```

Then send the browser to `/oauth2/authorize?client_id=my-app&request_uri=<request_uri>`.

Set `Oidc:RequirePushedAuthorizationRequests` to reject plain authorization requests entirely.

## Configuration reference

Everything below sits under `ark_oauth_server:Oidc` and is optional; defaults are shown.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `EnableDeviceFlow` | `true` | Serve the device authorization grant |
| `EnablePushedAuthorizationRequests` | `true` | Serve `/oauth2/par` |
| `RequirePushedAuthorizationRequests` | `false` | Refuse authorization requests that did not arrive via PAR |
| `EnableDynamicRegistration` | `false` | Serve `/oauth2/register` — it lets callers create clients |
| `RequireRegistrationAccessToken` | `true` | Require an initial access token to register |
| `AlwaysRequireConsent` | `false` | Show the consent screen even for first-party clients |
| `SessionLifetimeMinutes` | `480` | IdP session lifetime |
| `MaxFailedSignIns` | `10` | Consecutive failures before lockout; `0` disables |
| `LockoutMinutes` | `15` | Lockout duration |
| `DeviceCodeLifetimeSeconds` | `600` | Device code validity |
| `DevicePollIntervalSeconds` | `5` | Minimum device polling interval |
| `ParLifetimeSeconds` | `90` | `request_uri` validity |
| `CorsOrigins` | `[]` | Browser origins allowed to call the token, userinfo, discovery and JWKS endpoints — see below |

### Browser clients and `CorsOrigins`

A single-page application redeems its authorization code from the browser, so the token endpoint is
called cross-origin. Empty by default, which means no cross-origin call succeeds; list the exact
origins of your SPAs (scheme, host and port — there is no wildcard, because these endpoints hand
out tokens):

```jsonc
"ark_oauth_server": { "Oidc": { "CorsOrigins": [ "https://app.example.com" ] } }
```

The policy applies only to `/oauth2/token`, `/oauth2/userinfo`, discovery and JWKS, and never
allows credentials — a browser client authenticates with a bearer token, not a cookie. The host
enables it with `app.UseArkOidcCors()` between `UseRouting()` and `UseAuthorization()`.
Server-side clients need none of this.

A working example, including the JavaScript, is at `/flows/spa` in
[`Ark.Client.Web`](Ark.oAuth.Oidc/Ark.Client.Web/README.md#the-other-flows).

Per-client settings live on the client record: `access_token_lifetime_seconds`,
`id_token_lifetime_seconds`, `refresh_token_lifetime_seconds`,
`authorization_code_lifetime_seconds`, `require_pkce`, `require_par`, `require_consent`,
`refresh_token_rotation`, `token_endpoint_auth_method` and `is_active`.

---

## Registering clients

Through the admin console at `/oauth/{tenant}/v1/server/{tenant}_client/manage`, or with dynamic
registration when it is enabled:

```bash
curl -X POST https://idp.example.com/my_idp/oauth2/register \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <initial access token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "client_name": "My Service",
        "grant_types": ["client_credentials"],
        "token_endpoint_auth_method": "client_secret_basic",
        "scope": "reports.read"
      }'
```

The response carries the `client_secret` **once** — it is stored only as a PBKDF2 hash and
cannot be retrieved later. It also returns a `registration_access_token` for reading or deleting
the registration through `/oauth2/register/{client_id}` (RFC 7592).

Redirect URIs are validated at registration: they must be absolute, carry no fragment, and use
`https` unless they are loopback addresses.

Supported `token_endpoint_auth_method` values: `client_secret_basic`, `client_secret_post`,
`private_key_jwt`, `none`.

The initial access token must carry the `client.register` scope. That token comes from the client
credentials grant, so registration is a two-step chain: a machine client obtains a token, and that
token authorises the registration. The server seeds a machine client for this — `<tenant>_machine`,
registered for `client_credentials` and `client.register`, and deliberately created **without a
secret** so that no deployment ships with a well-known one. Give it a secret with **Regenerate
secret** in the admin console before using it.

`Ark.oAuth.Client` provides both halves (`ArkClientCredentials`, `ArkRegistration`), and
[`Ark.Client.Web`](Ark.oAuth.Oidc/Ark.Client.Web/README.md#the-other-flows) drives them from
`/flows/register`.

---

## Key management

Each tenant has a signing key published at `/.well-known/jwks.json`. Rotation is two-phase, so it
never invalidates tokens still in flight:

1. The new key becomes `active` and starts signing.
2. The previous key moves to `rollover` and stays published, so clients that cached JWKS keep
   validating tokens signed with it.
3. Once the longest-lived token signed by the old key has expired, retire it.

Keys are generated in-process. Nothing is fetched from an external key service.

---

## Upgrading from the v1 endpoints

The original `/oauth/{tenant}/v1/…` routes still work and keep their original request and
response shapes. What changed underneath is that they now delegate to the standard protocol
core, so codes issued there are single-use, expire, and **have their PKCE verifier checked** —
that check did not previously exist.

For existing databases, run migration `00003`:

```
GET /api/migration/v1/sql?action=up&name=00003_sql.sql
```

It adds the protocol state tables and the RFC 7591 metadata columns, seeds the scope catalogue,
and adopts each tenant's existing RSA key as its active signing key with `kid = tenant_id`, so
tokens already issued keep validating.

To migrate an application:

| v1 | Standard |
|---|---|
| Paste `rsaPublic` into config | Discovered from `jwks_uri` |
| `authServerUrl` + `tenantId` | `Authority` (the two joined) |
| `/oauth/{t}/v1/connect/authorize` | `/{t}/oauth2/authorize` |
| `/oauth/{t}/v1/token` | `/{t}/oauth2/token` |
| `/oauth/{t}/v1/.well-known/{c}/openid-configuration` | `/{t}/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| Custom `redirect_relative` handling | Standard `CallbackPath` |

Set `ark_oauth_client:UseLegacyFlow` to `true` to keep the old client middleware during the
transition. It does not validate `state` or `nonce`; treat it as a migration aid.

---

## Security notes

Behaviour worth knowing about when operating this server:

- **PKCE is enforced.** A public client must send `code_challenge`, and the verifier is checked
  against it at the token endpoint. The `plain` method is not accepted.
- **Codes and refresh tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes.** Read access to the database does not
  yield redeemable credentials.
- **Replay is treated as compromise.** Reusing an authorization code revokes the tokens derived
  from that session; reusing a refresh token revokes its whole family.
- **Redirect URIs are matched exactly.** No wildcards or prefix matching. The one exception is
  the port of a loopback address, for native apps (RFC 8252 §7.3).
- **Errors before `redirect_uri` is validated render as a page**, never as a redirect — otherwise
  the authorization endpoint would be an open redirect.
- **The introspection endpoint requires client authentication**, so it cannot be used as an
  oracle to test captured tokens.
- **Client authentication failures are constant-time**, and an unknown `client_id` costs the same
  as a bad secret.
- **Sign-in failures return a single message** regardless of cause, so the login form cannot be
  used to enumerate accounts. Repeated failures trigger lockout.
- **The sign-in and consent pages load no third-party resources.** Their CSS is inlined, so they
  work offline and under a strict Content-Security-Policy. The only external requests are the
  logo and policy URLs you configure yourself.

Before going to production:

1. Change the `admin` / `admin` password.
2. Set a strong `DefaultPw`.
3. Keep `RequireHttpsMetadata` at `true`.
4. Leave `EnableDynamicRegistration` off unless you need it, and keep
   `RequireRegistrationAccessToken` on if you do.
5. Give confidential clients real secrets and set `token_endpoint_auth_method` accordingly.
